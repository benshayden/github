Wind chimes are a neat idea: let the randomness of the wind create unheard music. But they end up just overplaying a single chord.

Cheap chimes are also usually annoyingly tinny, but we can easily and cheaply make larger, more sonorous chimes using PVC pipe.

But how do we make wind chimes produce more varied music?

Many great songs use only 4 chords: [I, V, vi, IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_containing_the_I%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93vi%E2%80%93IV_progression).

You could have 4 wind chimes together, one playing each chord, but they would all play at the same time.

How could you organize 4 wind chimes such that only one of them would play at once?

Wind tunnels pointing in the 4 compass directions!

When the wind blows north, a wind tunnel guides the wind so that it only sounds the key major chord wind chime, while protecting the other 3 chimes from disturbance. South: V. East: vi. West: IV.
You could tell the direction and general strength of the wind without even looking.

But what if the wind usually blows the same direction where you live? Say, off an ocean or around a building. You'd be back to overplaying a single chord.

Set the whole thing rotating! But you don't want it to spin freely, or else it would probably just switch between two chords.

You'd need a separate set of wind tunnels, all guiding the wind into a single tunnel that rotates the 4 chord tunnel assembly. The stronger the wind blows, the faster the chord tunnel assembly rotates between chords. The rotation tunnel assembly could use more than 4 tunnels to more efficiently capture the wind from any angle.
