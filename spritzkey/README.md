A Kindle can cost over $100, takes several seconds to turn on and find your place, and doesn't even fit in most pockets.
Spritzkey is an e-reader that costs <$60, resumes reading instantly, and fits on your keychain.
It displays one word at a time like [spritz](https://benshayden.github.io/github/spritz.html) on a tiny OLED display.
When plugged into USB, you can copy text files to its SD card like any other flash drive.
