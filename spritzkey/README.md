Alexandria is a library in your pocket.

A Kindle can cost over $100, takes several seconds to turn on and find your place, and doesn't even fit in most pockets.
Alexandria displays one word at a time like [spritz](https://benshayden.github.io/github/spritz.html).
It keeps your place for you so you can resume reading at the touch of a button, and stops spritzing at the release of a button so you never lose your place.
