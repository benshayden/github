A Kindle can cost over $100, takes several seconds to turn on and find your place, and doesn't even fit in most pockets.
Spritzkey is an e-reader that costs <$60, resumes reading instantly, and fits on your keychain.
It displays one word at a time like [spritz](https://benshayden.github.io/github/spritz.html) on a tiny OLED display. It reads books from an SD card. It enumerates as a flash storage drive when plugged into a USB host so you can copy text files containing books to its SD card. It keeps your place for you so you can resume reading at the touch of a button, and stops spritzing at the release of a button so you never lose your place.
