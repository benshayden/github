Shoe is a **custom tailored** 3d-printed arduino USB keyboard _as comfortable as an old shoe_. By positioning buttons precisely in 3d space around your individual fingers, the travel distance from your finger to each button is reduced to zero.

1. Acquire the items listed in bom.txt. If you substitute different buttons, then you may need to tweak the 3d-printed button mounts.
2. Measure the relevant aspects of your fingers. Configure the button mounts to fit them. Don't forget to leave room for the buttons themselves.
3. Print the button mounts, one for each of however many fingers you have. If you don't have any fingers, you can design your own 3d-printed button mounts to place buttons wherever is most comfortable for you.
4. Solder one diode and one resistor to each button. Solder insulated leads to the diode and resistor, about 8cm or 3-4 inches long.
5. Charlieplex the buttons to the microcontroller.
6. Charlieplex the LEDs.
7. Move everything else aside and look at your hands, or whatever you press buttons with. Relax them. Let them fall into a comfortable position. Practice moving your fingers 2mm (1/16 inch) forward, down, back. Visualize room between your thumb and index finger for the button there. Finally, holding your hand in that comfortable position, use your other hand to place one button mount on each finger at a time. Update your hand position accordingly to allow for the button mount.
8. Beginning with the thumb, bend the coat hanger to hold the button mounts in position around your fingers in their comfortable position.
9. Slide the buttons into the grooves in the button mounts, and bend the leads to hold them in place.
10. Snap the button mounts into the coat hanger.
11. Practice typing with your new keyboard. Have patience with yourself.
