Shoe is a custom-tailored USB keyboard that is as comfortable as an old shoe. By positioning buttons precisely in 3d space around your individual fingers, the travel distance from your finger to each button is reduced to zero.

1. Measure your fingers and configure [printable parts](http://openjscad.org/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benshayden/github/master/shoe/shoe.jscad). Use [cloud.netfabb](https://netfabb.azurewebsites.net/) to clean up the models.
1. Acquire the parts:
  * 50x [buttons](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/EVQ-QJJ05Q/P8029SCT-ND/165317)
  * 50x [diodes](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/1N914BTR/1N914BCT-ND/458919)
  * 50x [100K Ohm](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/CFM12JT100K/S100KHCT-ND/2617545)
  * 10x [500K Ohm](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/CFM12JT510K/S510KHCT-ND/2617424)
  * some LEDs
  * Print the button mounts you configured or designed using [fictiv](https://www.fictiv.com/) or [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/) or [i.materialise](http://i.materialise.com/), [UPS](http://www.theupsstore.com/small-business-solutions/Pages/3d-printing-locations.aspx) or a [local hackerspace](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces) or your own printer.
1. Solder a diode and a 100K resistor to each button. Solder insulated leads to the diode and resistor, about 8cm or 3-4 inches long.
1. [Charlieplex the buttons](https://cdn.rawgit.com/benshayden/github/fa1d9b66a3ab6c28a09d01b76f260b5df45dfd6d/shoe/circuit.svg)
1. Charlieplex the LEDs.
1. Slide the buttons into the grooves in the button mounts, and bend the leads to hold them in place.
1. Cut the coat-hanger into 10cm-15cm (4-6 inches) sections. These will form the skeleton.
1. Secure the mounts to the coat-hanger skeleton bones.
1. Secure the other ends of the skeleton bones to the 3d printed base.
1. Stop. Bonsai time. Move everything else aside and take a moment to look at your hands. Relax them. Let them fall into a comfortable position. Imagine and practice pressing buttons by moving your fingers 2mm (1/16 inch) forward, down, back. Mr. Miyagi say: Think "typing hands".
1. Make typing hands: bend the coat-hanger skeleton bones to position the button mounts where your fingers want to be.
1. Practice typing with your new keyboard as much as you can every day, but have patience with yourself when you need to go back to a flat keyboard. Muscles take a few weeks to learn.
