Flat keyboards require fingers to reach a long way. 3d-printing allows custom tailoring a keyboard so all of the buttons are literally right at your fingertips, reducing travel distance to zero.

It's easy to measure your fingers, but it can be difficult to know in advance how to space and angle the buttons between fingers for optimal comfort. A stiff but malleable wire such as a coat hanger can keep the buttons in place while typing, and still allow remodelling without waiting for a 3d-printer to reprint the entire keyboard and waste material.

When it looks right, flip displayMode to printable and download the STL. [Clean up the STL](https://netfabb.azurewebsites.net/). Print it at [fictiv](https://www.fictiv.com/) or [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/) or [i.materialise](http://i.materialise.com/) or [UPS](http://www.theupsstore.com/small-business-solutions/Pages/3d-printing-locations.aspx) or a [local hackerspace](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces) or your own printer.
