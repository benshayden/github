Flat keyboards require fingers to reach a long way. With 3d-printing, it is possible to custom tailor a keyboard so all of the buttons are literally right at your fingertips, reducing travel distance to zero.

It's easy to measure your fingers, but it can be difficult to know in advance how to space and angle the buttons between fingers for optimal comfort. A stiff but malleable wire will keep the buttons in place while typing and can still be re-configured with pliers without waiting for a 3d-printer and wasting material.
