Computer-Human Interaction Research

This is a simple web app that asks the user to perform interactions
such as clicking, scrolling, or loading,
delays those interactions by a random amount of time,
asks the user whether the interaction was bad,
stores information about the interaction,
and presents an analysis of what percentage of users
found what flavors of interactions with what amounts of delay
to be bad.
