Learning an oligosynthetic language should only require memorizing a few dozen to a few hundred morphemes, from which many other words could be synthesized. However, the quality of compound words can vary significantly. A high-quality compound word such as "bad = good opposite" is not likely to require separate memorization. A low-quality compound word such as "banana = one quantity above life towards" is likely to require memorization separate from the list of root words.
Before abandoning oligosynthesis in favor of the pidgin path, there are still a few methods of problem-solving that have not yet been applied to this problem. For example, the quality of an oligosynthetic language could be operationalized as the number of root words plus the number of compound words that would require separate memorization from a standard vocabulary such as Ogden's Basic English. This scoring allows optimizing the set of root sememes independently from grammar and phonology.
This form allows a community to build a database of compound words and vote on their quality. It is language-agnostic, so it can be used to score any vocabulary in any language.
